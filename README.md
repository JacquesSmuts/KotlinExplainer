# KotlinExplainer
A Repo to show differences between Kotlin and Java, with samples before and after conversion


## Usage
This project does not compile. It is simply a lot of basic examples of Kotlin Code.

Errors and warnings are kept for demonstrative purposes.

All of the code is located in [KotlinExplainer/app/src/main/java/com/example/jacquessmuts/kotlinexplainer/](https://github.com/JacquesSmuts/KotlinExplainer/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/jacquessmuts/kotlinexplainer)

The folder [KotlinExplainer/app/src/main/java/com/example/jacquessmuts/kotlinexplainer/javavskotlin] contains Java files that you need to convert to kotlin, and compare with the already-converted example to see how to convert java effectively.
